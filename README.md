# Recurse Roulette App

The site (recurse.roulette.com) works best in Chrome, but if you'd rather not do that you can use the Electron-based desktop app instead:

- Mac
- Windows
- Linux


## Build Yourself

If you're not using Windows you'll need to install [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to build the Windows executables.
